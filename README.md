Shocktube-Cantera
=================

Cantera Version 2.1.1 modifications for Shocktube Ignition
This repository is for additional classes that can be added to the already existing Cantera-2.1.1 library. (For more information about Cantera please see the attached linked to the citation at the end of this README file.)
The two classes that are included in this repository are the ShocktubeIdealGasReactor and ShockProp as well as the necessary changes to the parent class ReactoBase(only minor changes were made to this already existing file in the Cantera 2.1.1 library to allow for the addition of the new derived class ShocktubeIdealGasReactor).
